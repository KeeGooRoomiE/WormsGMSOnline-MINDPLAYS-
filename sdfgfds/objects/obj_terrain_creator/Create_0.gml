/// @description Info

/// This object is the parent for the terrain brush objects. It has no code
/// and requires none, but must be included as part of any project that uses 
///	this asset as the controller object will use it to create any terrain from 
///	any brush instances used in the room editor. Note that you can create your 
///	own custom brushes and they will work (rectangles and circles ONLY) as long
/// as they are children of this object. Also note that brushes can be stretched
/// in the room editor (see the DEMO room) and they will be correctly used to
///	generate terrain.
